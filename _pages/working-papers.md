## "Portfolio Shifts and Financial Intermediation: A DSGE Analysis of U.S. Household Deposit Outflows”

This paper develops a New Keynesian DSGE model with a segmented financial sector to study U.S. households' post-pandemic shift out of non-transaction deposits. Households allocate savings between deposits and bank-holding-company (BHC) debt subject to a financial-distress cost; BHC equity capital replaces lost deposits; traditional banks reduce credit lines; and a bank-funded shadow bank lends more to risky borrowers. Monetary, macroprudential, and a production-loan purchase facility are embedded. Estimated using Bayesian techniques on U.S. data (2009:Q3--2025:Q2), the model simulates a 24.0 percent decline in deposits from 2022:Q1 to 2025:Q1, compared to a 20.4 percent decline in non-transaction deposits of U.S. households. A one-standard-deviation negative household financial-distress shock reduces deposit shares by 1.4 percent and increases BHC investment by 3.3 percent. It also reallocates credit away from traditional bank borrowers toward a shadow bank, raising its investment up to 0.2 percent after the shock. Variance decompositions attribute most movements in deposit shares to the household financial-distress shock, while technology, monetary and debt-investment shocks explain much of credit-volume variation.  



## **["A Holistic Approach to Macroeconomic Fundamentals: Joint Estimates of Natural Rates"](https://simseo520.github.io/files/Natural_Rate_of_Unemployment.pdf)** 
### with Regis Barnichon, Christian Matthes, and Byung Goog Park


We develop a method to jointly estimate natural rates—or ‘stars’—
from long-run macroeconomic data. The approach embeds prior information about natural rates into a time-varying parameter VAR
with stochastic volatility. It explicitly accounts for measurement error and outliers, making it well suited for historical analysis, including episodes like the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic inflation surge.
