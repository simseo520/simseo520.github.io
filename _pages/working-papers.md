## "Portfolio Shifts and Financial Intermediation: A DSGE Analysis of U.S. Household Deposit Outflows”

This paper develops a New Keynesian DSGE model with a segmented financial sector to study U.S. households' post-pandemic shift out of non-transaction deposits. Households allocate savings between deposits and bank-holding-company (BHC) debt subject to a financial-distress cost; BHC equity capital replaces lost deposits; retail banks extend credit lines; and a bank-funded shadow bank lends to riskier startups. Monetary, macroprudential, and a production-loan purchase facility are embedded. Calibrated and Bayesian-estimated on U.S. data (2009:Q3--2025:Q2), the model simulates a 24 percent of decline in deposits from 2022:Q1 to 2025:Q1, compared to a 20.4 percent of decline in non-transaction deposits of U.S. households. A household financial-distress shock reduces deposit shares, increases BHC investment, and reallocates credit away from traditional bank borrowers toward Nonbank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), raising their investment. Variance decompositions attribute most movements in deposit shares to the household financial-distress shock, while technology, monetary and debt-to-investment shocks explain much of credit-volume variation.  



## **["A Holistic Approach to Macroeconomic Fundamentals: Joint Estimates of Natural Rates"](https://simseo520.github.io/files/Natural_Rate_of_Unemployment.pdf)** 
### with Regis Barnichon, Christian Matthes, and Byung Goog Park


We develop a method to jointly estimate natural rates—or ‘stars’—
from long-run macroeconomic data. The approach embeds prior information about natural rates into a time-varying parameter VAR
with stochastic volatility. It explicitly accounts for measurement error and outliers, making it well suited for historical analysis, including episodes like the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic inflation surge.
