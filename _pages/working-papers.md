## "Portfolio Shifts and Financial Intermediation: A DSGE Analysis of U.S. Household Deposit Outflows”

This paper develops a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General
Equilibrium (NK–DSGE) model with financial intermediation to investigate the effects of recent changes in U.S. households’ portfolio choices on the overall economy. The model incorporates stylized features to represent recent observations in the U.S. financial market, such as the decrease in non-transaction deposits held by households, the increase in investment from bank holding companies to their subsidiary banks, and the rise in loans from banks to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). The model is calibrated and estimated using U.S. data from 2009:Q3
to 2025:Q2. The model suggests that changes in the financial distress of households can alter the composition of their financial assets, the funding sources of banks, and their lending activities sequentially. The stylized framework of this paper provides a tractable tool to represent the reallocations in the financial market and investigate their implications for macroeconomic policies.



## **["A Holistic Approach to Macroeconomic Fundamentals: Joint Estimates of Natural Rates"](https://simseo520.github.io/files/Natural_Rate_of_Unemployment.pdf)** 
### with Regis Barnichon, Christian Matthes, and Byung Goog Park


We develop a method to jointly estimate natural rates—or ‘stars’—
from long-run macroeconomic data. The approach embeds prior information about natural rates into a time-varying parameter VAR
with stochastic volatility. It explicitly accounts for measurement error and outliers, making it well suited for historical analysis, including episodes like the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-pandemic inflation surge.
