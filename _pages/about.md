Welcome to my webpage!

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Indiana University, Bloomington. My research interest lie in *Macroeconomics, Macroeconometrics, Monetary Economics, and financial economics*. I am particularly interested in studying the financial intermediation of banking sector using Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium approach.

I am on the job market in the 2025-26 academic year.
