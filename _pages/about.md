Welcome to my webpage!
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Indiana University, Bloomington. My research interests lie in *Macroeconomics, Macroeconometrics, Monetary Economics, and Financial Economics*. My job market paper studies financial intermediation and macroeconomic policies via the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) approach. You can find my job market and working papers [here](/working-papers/).

I am on the job market in the 2025-26 academic year.
